Reminder software is a simple event management program that can schedule our daily plans, 
reminder with pop-up window and sound to ensure that you don't miss an important appointment or deadline.
If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, it makes sense to keep your schedule or calendar there too.
No matter how well you set up your todo list and calendar, you aren't going to get things done unless you have a reliable way of reminding yourself to actually do them
A trigger is anything that you put “in your way” to remind you to do something,
The best triggers are related in some way to the behavior you want to produce
Anything that catches your attention and reminds you to do something can be a trigger. An alarm clock or kitchen timer is a perfect example — when the bell rings, you know to wake up or take the quiche out of the oven. (Hopefully you remember which trigger goes with which behavior!)
Automated reminders can help you build habits but it can also help you remember things that are too important to be trusted even to habit.
My advice is to set reminders for just about everything so you never have to think about it — and never have to worry about forgetting.
Your weekly review is a good time to enter new reminders for the coming weeks or months. I simply don't want to think about what I'm supposed to be doing; I want to be reminded so I can think just about actually doing it.
